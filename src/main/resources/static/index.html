			<p>
			<h1>General Rule</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Stock must be hedged, using hedging stock, shorting, gold,
					oil or other methods.</li>
				<li>For long term position, holding value stocking might be
					fine in long run, but need to watch out financial reports to
					prevent pivots.</li>
				<li>Shorting and options are having risks. Need to watch out
					the environments all the time.</li>
				<li>Pay close attention to political changes, wars and public
					health issues. Even making less gain it is ok, better cash out if
					there is a chance.</li>
				<li>Research in ETF, Bonds, Forex or foreign market stocks for
					diversities.</li>
				<li>Crisis normally indicates opportunities, however, prepare
					cash for it before hand.</li>
				<li>Short term trading gain is debatable but in my theory it
					compounds fast depending on how you act.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1>Specific Rule for Short Term</h1>

			<h2>Time management</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Sell in high rising day, djia goes 100-400 higher for
					instance, and buy it in low days.</li>
				<li>Trading time matters, selling it at opening is fine, or
					before 9:45 AM, best to be around 10:00 AM. Or short sell during
					this time. As dump money and people's hype is high at 10:00 and
					going down after 10:30 AM, so buy after 10:30.</li>
				<li>In a big sales day, when index drops a few hundreds, watch
					closely around 10:00 to 10:30 AM. Don't go earlier than that. And
					watch to buy more during 3:00-4:00 PM. As panic goes in and peak at
					10:30 AM.</li>
				<li>Friday is normally a good day.</li>
				<li>Don't trade if you are tiring, sick or not feeling well. <br/>
					Rest for a few days and good result may come. <br/>
					Keep reading and study. <br/>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Fund management</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Before any crisis, cash out, and watch for opportunities.
					Better not to buy anything. Don't go to buy mutual funds. Mutual
					funds depends on the stock price as well, it is not going to hedge
					anything.</li>
				<li>When stock price is at historically high, and shorting is
					at high risk too, then need to check out gold stock and bonds.</li>
				<li>At any buy day, keep your funds half in cash or margin
					balance in case you made some mistake to save the positions.</li>
				<li>When your research is not confident, don't buy.</li>
				<li>When you don't want to trade, study but don't waste your
					time.</li>
				<li>If you really want to buy and you are not sure, buy 10
					shares, if it turns out good, then you can fill out more.</li>
				<li>Don't put the heavy load in one buy, buy in batches, batch
					side depends on the stock price and possibility to go up or down. <b><br />Batch
						size: <br /> stock price 20 or less: size 100. <br /> stock price
						around 20-50: size 50. <br /> stock price around 50-100: size 25.<br />
						stock price over 100: size 20. <br /> stock price close to 300:
						size 10. <br /> stock price close over 500: size 3. <br /> </b>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>
				Adjust positions
				</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Adjust position can be risky, note that if you are seeking
						the price in half way of your price and the target price, you will
						have to double your investment and shares. That is geometric
						sequence, which is 2, 4, 8, 16. You will need to read chart and do
						a prediction before you just double down.</li>
					<li>In any case where you don't have funds anymore and you
						want to save your stocks, you will need to manually stop limit by
						getting rid of of some shares, get money back and reinvest. I
						don't do automatic <b>stop limit but do it manually</b> as
						automatic can be more risker.
					</li>
					<li><b>Short more in a big plunging day, and the momentum
							and news is very positive for you.</b></li>
					<li><b>Buy more in a big rising day.</b></li>
				</ul>
				Note: The above looks not normal for many people. Note that buy more
				in a big rising day, so it can easily pass the price you bought. And
				this buy is to save your position, not looking for a under-valued
				opportunity. For looking to buy and make a fortunate, we need to
				wait to buy in a day where there was big blood on the street, which
				is near the bottom of a crisis. <br /> Likewise, you need to short
				more and strong when it is a big dropping day, and it has the
				possibility to drop below the price you shorted.
				
				<h2>Shorting</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Do not short if the current price is lower than the open
						price, there is a high possibility it could reverse. The chance to
						win is only 50%.</li>
					<li>Short a stock that is historical high and there is no
						reason it will stay there and go up forever.</li>
					<li>Try to short traditional stocks for less risks. High tech stocks tends to 
						have a lot of irrational. 
					</li>
					<li>In rare cases where the market is unreasonable high, short more than buy more.</li>
					<li>One indication for big market crash is that oil price is dropping and gold/silver is high.
						If interest rate and bond market can not tell you that, oil price plunge before the market crash.
						Get your ammo and ready for a big crash, buy in batch.
					</li>
				</ul>
